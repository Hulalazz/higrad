Description: Implements the Hierarchical Incremental GRAdient Descent (HiGrad) algorithm,
    a first-order algorithm for finding the minimizer of a function in online learning just like stochastic gradient descent (SGD).
    In addition, this method attaches a confidence interval to assess the uncertainty of its predictions.
