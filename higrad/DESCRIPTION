Description: The higrad package implements the Hierarchical Incremental GRAdient Descent (HiGrad) algorithm.
    HiGrad is a first-order algorithm for finding the minimizer of a function in online learning just like SGD and, 
    in addition, this method attaches a confidence interval to assess the uncertainty of its predictions.
