# HiGrad

This is the R package for HiGrad (Hierarchical Incremental Gradient Descent), 
an algorithm for statistical inference for online learning and stochastic approximation.
Also included in this repository are the R codes for reproducing the results and plots
of the simulation and real data study in Su & Zhu, 2018.

#### Description


Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is an immensely popular approach for online learning in 
settings where data arrives in a stream or data sizes are very large. 
However, despite an ever-increasing volume of work on SGD, much less is known about the 
statistical inferential properties of SGD-based predictions. 
Taking a fully inferential viewpoint, this paper introduces a novel procedure termed 
HiGrad to conduct statistical inference for online learning, 
without incurring additional computational cost compared with the vanilla SGD. 
The HiGrad procedure begins by performing SGD iterations for a while and then split the single thread into a few, 
and this procedure hierarchically operates in this fashion along each thread. 
With predictions provided by multiple threads in place, 
a t-based confidence interval is constructed by decorrelating predictions 
using covariance structures given by the Ruppertâ€“Polyak averaging scheme. 
Under certain regularity conditions, the HiGrad confidence interval 
is shown to attain asymptotically exact coverage probability.
